        A digital research and development project creating gamified, web-based learning modules for Hispanic linguistics.
        Games.Hispanistica translates established linguistic content into interactive quiz and game formats that support
        structured analysis, comparison, and feedback-driven exploration.

      <h2>What it is</h2>

      <p>
        Games.Hispanistica is not a single application, but a modular collection of lightweight, web-based games, quizzes,
        and interactive tasks. These components operationalize linguistic concepts and categories in formats that emphasize
        decision-making, classification, and immediate feedback.
      </p>

      <p>
        The modules are designed for use in university teaching, project-based learning, and teacher education, and can be
        used either independently or in combination with other Hispanistica resources.
      </p>

      <h2>Content scope & integration</h2>

      <p>
        The project is closely aligned with the linguistic foundations developed in other Hispanistica initiatives,
        in particular <em>Spanische Linguistik @ School</em>. Rather than introducing independent content, Games.Hispanistica
        builds on existing explanations, terminologies, and examples, extending them through interactive formats.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typical topic areas include (examples): pronunciation and variation, error linguistics, morphosyntax, language change,
        and multilingualism. The concrete selection and implementation of topics evolve over time.
      </p>

      <h2>Collaborative development</h2>

      <p>
        Game concepts and content are developed collaboratively with students in research-oriented and project-based teaching
        contexts. Modules are iteratively designed, tested, revised, and expanded as part of ongoing academic work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Code and technical implementation are developed by the project lead, supported by AI-assisted programming workflows.
        This approach enables rapid prototyping while maintaining transparent, well-documented, and reusable code structures.
      </p>

      <h2>Code & Open Science</h2>

      <p>
        Games.Hispanistica is developed as an open-source project. The complete codebase is publicly available and published
        under the MIT License, following established Hispanistica principles of transparency, reproducibility, and reuse.
      </p>

      <h2>Releases & citation</h2>

      <p>
        A structured release strategy is planned following established practices from other Hispanistica projects.
        Code and quiz/game content will be versioned and published separately via Zenodo.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Separate releases for software and content</li>
        <li>Concept DOI with version-specific DOIs</li>
        <li>Clear separation of code, content, and documentation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        DOI information will be added as releases become available.
      </p>

      <h2>Status</h2>

      <p>
        Games.Hispanistica is currently under active development. Individual modules are released incrementally as they reach
        a stable and documented state.
